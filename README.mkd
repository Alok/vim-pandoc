vim-pantondoc
=============

Experimental writer plugin for vim (heavily rearchitecured vim-pandoc).

As of commit c60e14e101f9192ab3b27e8dc24e176dbeaa2b10, vim-pantondoc is
considered to be in feature parity with vim-pandoc.

**IMPORTANT**: Requires vim 7.4 (makes use of the new python facilities).
Doesn't provide syntax support. Use
[vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax)
alongside this for that.


## Features (Implemented or Planed)

* Modular architecure. (I)
* pandoc-markdown syntax can be set to be used only for certain file
  extensions, instead of being the default for all pandoc-supported file
  formats. As a side effect you can use pantondoc with textile and
  restructuredText files. (I)
* Expanded support for working with bibliographies. (I, partially) Aditional
  information on the bibliography items can be gathered from tooltips, where
  supported.
* Annotations: add metadata to your files (comments, TODOs, etc.) (P)
